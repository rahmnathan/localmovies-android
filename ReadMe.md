Android client for LocalMovies backend system.

Android app displays media metadata based on sub-directory query and plays media locally or on a Google Cast device.
The app is 'event-based' in that it only loads all media metadata on first use and then stores the data in
a local database. Each time the app is launched, a query is made for events (create/update/delete), 
processes them, and adds them to the database. This strategy ensures a better user experience 
as well as reducing the load on the backend services.
